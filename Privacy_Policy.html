                                To use the features of Google Maps, it is necessary to save your IP address. This
                                information is usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. The
                                provider of this site has no influence on this data transfer. If Google Maps is
                                activated, Google can use Google Fonts to ensure consistent font display. When you visit
                                Google Maps, your browser loads the required web fonts into your browser cache to
                                display text and fonts correctly.
