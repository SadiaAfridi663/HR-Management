                Other data is collected automatically or with your consent by our IT systems when you visit the website.
                This primarily involves technical data (e.g., internet browser, operating system, or time of page
                access). This data is collected automatically as soon as you access this website</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">What do we use your data for?</h2>
            <p class="text-md text-gray-800">Some of the data is collected to ensure the error-free provision of the
                website. Other data may be used to analyze your user behavior.</p>

            <p class="text-md text-gray-800">You have the right to obtain information about the origin, recipient, and
                purpose of your stored personal data free of charge at any time. You also have the right to request the
                correction or deletion of this data. If you have given your consent to data processing, you can revoke
                this consent at any time with effect for the future. Furthermore, you have the right to request the
                restriction of the processing of your personal data under certain circumstances. Furthermore, you have
                the right to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority. <br>You can contact us at any
                time with any questions about this or other issues relating to data protection.

                contract data, contact details, names, website access, and other data generated via a website.
                <br>External hosting is carried out for the purpose of fulfilling our contract with our potential and

                device (e.g., device fingerprinting) within the meaning of the TDDDG. Consent can be revoked at any
                time. <br>Our host(s) will only process your data to the extent necessary to fulfill their service

                explains what data we collect and what we use it for. It also explains how and for what purpose.We would
                like to point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g., when communicating via email) may be
                subject to security gaps. Complete protection of data from access by third parties is not possible.</p>

                <br>Email: bhr@gamil.com

                <br>The responsible body is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others decides on the
                purposes and means of processing personal data (e.g. names, e-mail addresses, etc.).
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">Storage period</h2>
            <p class="text-md text-gray-800">Unless a more specific storage period has been specified in this privacy
                policy, your personal data will remain with us until the purpose for data processing no longer applies.
                If you assert a legitimate request for deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data
                will be deleted unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g.,
                retention periods under tax or commercial law); in the latter case, deletion will occur once these
                reasons no longer apply.</p>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">General information on the legal basis for data processing on
                this website</h2>
            <p class="text-md text-gray-800">If you have consented to data processing, we will process your personal
                data on the basis of Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR or Art. 9 (2) (a) GDPR if special categories of data are
                processed pursuant to Art. 9 (1) GDPR. In the event of express consent to the transfer of personal data
                to third countries, data processing will also be carried out on the basis of Art. 49 (1) (a) GDPR. If
                you have consented to the storage of cookies or to access information on your device (e.g. via device
                fingerprinting), data processing will also be carried out on the basis of Section 25 (1) TDDDG. Consent
                can be revoked at any time. If your data is required to fulfil the contract or to carry out
                pre-contractual measures, we will process your data on the basis of Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR. Furthermore, if
                your data is required to fulfil a legal obligation, we will process it on the basis of Art. 6 (1) (c)
                GDPR. Data processing may also be based on our legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. The
                relevant legal bases in each individual case are explained in the following paragraphs of this privacy
                policy.</p>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">Note on data transfer to third countries that are not secure
                under data protection law and on transfer to US companies that are not DPF-certified</h2>
            <p class="text-md text-gray-800">We use tools from companies based in third countries where data protection
                is not secure, as well as US tools whose providers are not certified under the EU-US Data Privacy
                Framework (DPF). If these tools are active, your personal data may be transferred to these countries and
                processed there. We would like to point out that a level of data protection comparable to that in the EU
                cannot be guaranteed in third countries where data protection is not secure. <br>We would like to point
                out that the USA, as a safe third country, generally offers a level of data protection comparable to
                that of the EU. Data transfer to the USA is therefore permitted if the recipient is certified under the
                "EU-US Data Privacy Framework" (DPF) or has appropriate additional safeguards. Information on transfers
                to third countries, including the data recipients, can be found in this privacy policy.</p>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">Recipients of personal data</h2>
            <p class="text-md text-gray-800">As part of our business activities, we work with various external parties.
                In some cases, this also requires the transfer of personal data to these external parties. We only pass
                on personal data to external parties if this is necessary to fulfill a contract, if we are legally
                obliged to do so (e.g., passing on data to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest in the
                transfer pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR, or if another legal basis permits the data transfer. When
                using contract processors, we only pass on our customers' personal data on the basis of a valid contract
                for order processing. In the case of joint processing, a contract for joint processing is concluded.</p>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">Revocation of your consent to data processing</h2>
            <p class="text-md text-gray-800">Many data processing operations are only possible with your express
                consent. You can revoke your consent at any time. The legality of the data processing carried out up to
                the time of revocation remains unaffected.</p>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">Right to object to data collection in special cases and to
                direct marketing (Article 21 GDPR)</h2>
            <p class="text-md text-gray-800">If data processing is based on Article 6 (1) (e) or (f) of the GDPR, you
                have the right to object to the processing of your personal data at any time for reasons related to your
                particular situation; this also applies to profiling based on these provisions. The respective legal
                basis on which processing is based can be found in this privacy policy. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER
                PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL DATA UNLESS WE CAN PROVE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING WHICH
                OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OR THE PROCESSING SERVES TO ASSERT, EXERCISE OR DEFEND
                LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21 (1) GDPR). <br>If your personal data is processed for direct
                marketing purposes, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of personal data
                concerning you for such marketing purposes; this also applies to profiling insofar as it is associated
                with such direct marketing. If you object, your personal data will subsequently no longer be used for
                direct marketing purposes (objection pursuant to Art. 21 (2) GDPR).
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">Right to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory
                authority</h2>
            <p class="text-md text-gray-800">In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects have the right to
                lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of their habitual
                residence, place of work, or place of the alleged violation. This right of complaint is without
                prejudice to other administrative or judicial remedies.</p>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">Right to data portability</h2>
            <p class="text-md text-gray-800">You have the right to have data that we process automatically based on your
                consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common,
                machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will
                only be done if technically feasible.</p>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800">Information, correction and deletion</h2>
            <p class="text-md text-gray-800">Within the scope of applicable law, you have the right at any time to
                obtain free information about your stored personal data, its origin and recipient, and the purpose of
                data processing, as well as the right to have this data corrected or deleted. You can contact us at any

                deleted after your visit. Persistent cookies remain stored on your device until you delete them yourself
                or until they are automatically deleted by your web browser. <br>Cookies can originate from us
                (first-party cookies) or from third-party companies (so-called third-party cookies). Third-party cookies
                enable the integration of certain third-party services within websites (e.g., cookies for processing

                specified. The website operator has a legitimate interest in storing necessary cookies for the
                technically error-free and optimized provision of its services. If consent to the storage of cookies and
                similar recognition technologies has been requested, processing will take place exclusively on the basis
                of this consent (Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR and Section 25 (1) TDDDG); this consent can be revoked at any time.
